# memory_allocation

Objective: 

To simulate memory allocation with hole-fitting algorithms (First-fit, Best-fit) and 
implement deallocation and defragmentation of memory blocks. 
 
 
Specification: 

The program simulates memory allocation with a chosen hole-fitting algorithm (First-fit, 
Best-fit) and implements deallocation and defragmentation. A menu controls the 
operations, and each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices are:  
1) Enter parameters  
2) Allocate memory for a block 
3) Deallocate memory for a block 
4) Defragment memory 
5) Quit program and free memory
